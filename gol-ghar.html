        <h2>History of Gol Ghar</h2>
        <p>Gol Ghar, built in 1786, was designed by Captain John Garstin, a British officer, to store grain for the British East India Company. It is one of the largest granaries in India, with a capacity of over 140,000 tons of grain. Its distinctive dome-shaped structure was originally intended to help store surplus grain to prevent famines. However, the building never served its original purpose and instead became a famous historical and architectural site.</p>
        <p>The unique circular design of Gol Ghar stands out in Patna's skyline and attracts visitors from across the world.</p>
